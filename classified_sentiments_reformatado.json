        "PrefaceThis book provides an introduction to computer graphics for students who wish to learn the basic principles and techniques of the field and who in addition want to write substantial graphics applications themselves The field of computer graphics continues to enjoy tremendous vitality and growth The everincreasing number of featurelength animated movies has generated heady excitement about what graphics can do and the ready access to graphics everyone now has through computer games and the Internet is stimulating people to learn how to do it themselvesGraphics systems are getting better faster and cheaper at a bewildering rate and many new techniques are emerging each year from researchers and practitioners around the world but the underlying principles and approaches constitute a stable and coherent body of knowledge Much of this knowledge can be acquired through a single course in graphics and this book attempts to organize the ideas and methods to bring the reader from the beginning with modest programming skills to being able to design and produce significant graphics programs   INTENDED AUDIENCEThe book is designed as a text for either a one or twosemester course at the senior undergraduate or firstyear graduate level It can also be used for selfstudy It is aimed principally at students majoring in computer science or engineering but will also suit students in other fields such as physics and mathematics   Mathematical Background RequiredThe reader should have the equivalent of one year of college mathematics knowledge of elementary algebra geometry trigonometry and elementary calculus also is assumed Some exposure to vectors and matrices is useful but not essential as vector and matrix techniques are introduced in the context of graphics as they are needed and an appendix also summarizes the key ideasComputer graphics tends to use a lot of mathematics to express the geometric relationships between lines surfaces and the viewing eye Although no single mathematical notion is difficult in itself the sheer number of tools required can be daunting The book places particular emphasis on revealing the reasons for using this or that technique and on showing how the objects of interest in a graphics program are properly described by the mathematical objects we use   Computer Programming Background RequiredIn general the reader should have at least one semester of experience writing computer programs in C C or Java A lot of the programming in graphics involves the direct translation of geometric relationships into code and so uses straightforward variables functions arrays looping and testing which is similar from language to language C is used throughout the book but much of the material will be familiar to someone whose computer language background is only CIt is helpful for the reader to have experience as well in manipulating structs in C or classes in CThese are used to capture the rather complicated structure of some graphical objects that reside in a scene where the object say a castle or an airplane consists of many parts and these parts themselves consist of complex subparts Some experience with elementary linked data structures such as linked lists or trees is also desirable but not essentialA reader with knowledge of C but not C will need to pick up the basics of objectoriented programming We define a number of useful classes such as the Window Mesh Scene Camera and Texture classes and show why they are so convenient and usable Some of the hallmarks of objectoriented programming such as inheritance and polymorphism are used in a few contexts to make the programmers job easier but we do not place inordinate emphasis on a pure objectoriented approach   PHILOSOPHYThe book has been completely reorganized and rewritten from the first edition but the basic philosophy remains Computer graphics is learned by doing it One must write and test real programs to comprehend fully what is going on A principal goal of the book is to show readers how to translate a particular design task first into its underlying geometric components to find a suitable mathematical representation for the objects involved and finally to translate this representation into suitable algorithms and program code Readers start by learning how to develop simple routines to produce pictures Then methods for rendering drawings of ever more complex objects are presented in a stepbystep fashion   Exercises and ProblemsMore than 440 drill exercises appear throughout the book Most of these are of the stopandthink variety that require no programming and that allow readers to test their grasp of the material themselves Some urge the student to implement some of the new ideas in program codeIn addition case studies appear at the end of each chapter amounting to 100 in all These exercises are normally programming projects suitable for homework assignments and range from the simple to the challenging They expand on the material within their chapter and often extend ideas in new directions Whether or not the case studies are actually carried out by students they should be studied as an integral part of the chapterA suggested level of effort is associated with each case study to indicate the approximate investment in time a student may need to accomplish the task Programming is an unpredictable business and students abilities vary but the rough guide is as follows   Level of Effort A simple project that can be implemented in an evening suitable to be made due at the next class meeting A more extensive project that might be assigned to be due in a week so that a student has time to think about designing the program and has adequate time for the iterative and sometimes frustrating testing and debugging cycle that projects always seem to require A major project that might require three weeks to design and implement Such a project requires substantial design effort and careful program layout but would correctly be viewed as a major accomplishment by the student   Use of OpenGLA frequent stumbling block that appears as one first brushes up against computer graphics is getting started making pictures It is easy enough to write a program but there must be an underlying tool that ultimately draws the lines and curves on the screen Fortunately such a tool exists and is readily available OpenGL emerged from Silicon Graphics Inc in 1992 and has become a widely adopted graphics application programming interface API It provides the actual drawing tools through a collection of functions that are called within an application As described in Appendix 1 it is available usually through free downloads over the Internet for all types of computer systems encountered in colleges universities and industry OpenGL is easy to install and learn and its longevity as a standard API is being nurtured by the OpenGL Architecture Review Board ARB an industry consortium responsible for guiding the evolution of the softwareOne aspect of OpenGL that makes it so well suited for use in a computer graphics course is its device independence or portability Many university computer laboratories contain a variety of different computers A student can develop and run a program on any available computer The program can then be run on a different computer for testing or grading purposes perhaps and the graphics will be the same on the two machinesOpenGL offers a rich and highly usable API for 2D graphics and image manipulation but its real power emerges with 3D graphics Using OpenGL students can progress rapidly and produce stunning animations in only a singlesemester course   Use of C as the Programming LanguageC is now familiar enough to most students in engineering and computer science through a first programming course that it is the natural choice of language to use It offers several advantages over C such as passing parameters to functions by reference which reduces the need for explicit pointers and simplifies reading the code File 1O also is greatly simplified through streams and in general the syntax for all kinds of IO is clearer in C than in C To keep things simple in C no emphasis is placed on implementing operatorsFurthermore it is easy to develop handy utility classes in C such as those for a 2D or 3D point a line a window or a color which make code simpler and more robust Students see the benefit of hiding the details of a geometric object within the object itself and of imbuing the object with the ability to do things like draw itself or test whether it intersects another object The Canvas class developed in Chapter 3 offers a good example as it maintains its own notion of a window a viewport and a current position and it can draw basic figures with very little programming effort   Emphasis on 3D Computer GraphicsBecause playing games on personal computers has become so popular and so many dazzling animations are appearing in movies students are particularly interested in developing 3D graphics applications Accordingly several chapters from the first edition have been rewritten and rearranged in order to get to topics in 3D graphics as quickly as possible In a number of situations concepts are presented for the 2D case and the 3D case together which helps to clarify the distinctions between the two   Describing 3D Scenes with the use of Scene Design LanguageIt can be very awkward and time consuming to design a scene of many 3D objects using raw OpenGL commands So a simple Scene Design language SDL is introduced in Chapter 5 and fully defined in an appendix Using this language students can describe scenes with familiar terms like cube sphere and rotate and can build files of such instructions that can be read into their program at run time An appendix and the books Web Site provides code for an interpreter that can read an SDL file and build a list of objects described in the file It is then a simple matter to use OpenGL to draw the scene from the object listThis same language and interpreter is put to fine use in Chapter 14 in which the student develops code for ray tracing a scene described using SDL Students can therewith design and ray trace much more elaborate and interesting scenes than would be possible otherwise   Optional Use of PostScriptIn recent years POSTSCRIPT has become a de facto standard pagelayout language offering a rich set of operators for drawing text and graphics in a deviceindependent manner POSTSCRIPT usually works invisibly within a laser printer receiving commands from a wordprocessing or pagelayout program and converting them to lines dots and characters But it is possible for a student to prepare a script of POSTSCRIPT commands and direct it to a printer whereupon the onboard POSTSCRIPT interpreter creates the intended graphics Beautiful graphics can be created in this way Therefore POSTSCRIPT provides an excellent example of a concise and powerful 2D graphics language with many of the same capabilities as OpenGL to carry out transformations and perform renderingThe POSTSCRIPT language is introduced in an appendix and students interested in approaching graphics this way are shown how to create interesting scripts that produce pleasing pictures The appendix also shows how to download and work with GhostScript which provides an onscreen POSTSCRIPT interpreter so that pictures can be easily previewed and debugged during their development   ORGANIZATION OF THE BOOK AND COURSE PLANSThere is much more in this book than can be covered in a onesemester course or even in a twosemester course The book has been arranged so that the instructor can select different groups of chapters for close study depending on the length of the course and the interests and backgrounds of the students in the class Several such paths through the book are suggested here after the principal topics in each chapter are described   Brief Overview of Each ChapterChapter 1 This chapter gives an overview of the computer graphics field with examples of how various of its subfields are using graphics The different kinds of graphics display systems available are described along with the types of primitives polygons text images etc that a graphic system displays The chapter also describes some of the many kinds of input devices mouse tablet data glove etc that are in common useChapter 2 This chapter gets students started with writing graphics applications Programming using OpenGL is described and several complete linedrawing applications including the popular Sierpinski gasket are developed Techniques are discussed for using OpenGL to draw various primitives such as polylines and polygons and for using the mouse and keyboard in an interactive graphics application Case studies at the end of the chapter provide interesting programming projects to help students get a clear initial sense of how a graphics application is implementedChapter 3 Chapter 3 develops the central notion of the windowtoviewport mapping for sizing and positioning pictures on the display Doityourself management of windows and viewports is discussed as is using OpenGL to handle the details A first clipping algorithm is developed Zooming panning and tilting to achieve interesting visual effects are described as is the simple animation of figures A Canvas class is developed that encapsulates all of the tools The drawing of complex polygonbased figures circles and arcs is discussed as is the parametric form for representing both 2D and 3D curvesChapter 4 This chapter reviews vectors and their basic operations and shows the great benefits to be gained by using vector tools in graphics Students who are familiar with vectors can read the chapter quickly focusing on how vectors describe relations between the geometric objects they manipulate in their programs Where possible vector operations are treated without regard for the dimensionality of the space in question but the use of the cross product in 3D is given special emphasisThe notion of a coordinate frame is introduced and it is shown how such frames make it natural to work with homogeneous coordinates Affine combinations of points are discussed to clarify the difference between vectors and points to help avoid a common pitfall that arises when one writes graphics applications Several applications involving interpolation elementary Bezier curves and line intersections are developed The fundamental algorithm to clip a line against a convex polygon is developed in detail and more advanced clipping algorithms are addressed in the case studies An interesting project for 2D ray tracing is suggested in one case studyChapter 5 Transformations are of central importance in computer graphics and students sometimes have difficulty developing intuitions about themparticularly about 3D transformations This chapter develops the underlying theory of transforming figures and coordinate systems using affine transformations in both the 2D and 3D cases Homogeneous coordinates are employed from the start for describing transformations Special care is given to rotations in 3D which are notoriously difficult to visualizeTools are added to the Canvas class set forth in Chapter 3 to shift scale and rotate figures through the current transformation and OpenGLs matrix operations are enlisted to facilitate this feature An overview of the OpenGL viewing pipeline is then developed and the roles of the modelview projection and viewport transformations are described The drawing of 3D objects using OpenGLs tools is developed The use of Scene Description Language SDL is introduced and it is shown how to use the SDL interpreter to read in a description of a 3D scene from a file and to draw the objects represented in the fileChapter 6 In this chapter tools are developed for modeling and drawing complicated mesh objects Sample meshes are developed including polyhedra such as the dodecahedron and buckyball and more complex shapes such as arches domes tubes that undulate through space and surfaces of revolution Techniques are developed for rendering these objects either with flat or smooth shadingChapter 7 This chapter develops tools for the flexible viewing of 3D scenes The synthetic camera that forms perspectival views is defined and its relationship to the lowlevel viewing tools OpenGL provides is discussed A convenient Camera class is built that encapsulates the details of manipulating the camera and makes it easy to fly the camera through a scene in an animationThe mathematics of perspectival projections is then developed in detail along with a discussion of how OpenGL produces perspectival views through matrix manipulations The clipping algorithm that operates in homogeneous coordinate space which OpenGL also uses is developed in detail Methods for producing stereo views are introduced The chapter closes with a taxonomy of the many kinds of projections used in art architecture and engineering and shows how to produce each kind of projection in a programChapter 8 Chapter 8 tackles ways to make pictures of 3D scenes more realistic Shading models are developed that compute the various light components that reflect off of objects that are bathed in light Methods for using OpenGL to set up light sources and alter the surface material properties of objects are described OpenGLs depthbuffer method of removing hidden surfaces is described in detail Techniques for painting texture onto the surface of an object to make it more realistic are developed for both procedural and image textures Finally methods for adding simple shadows to pictures are presentedChapter 9 This chapter delves into the fascinating area of fractals and ways to generate images of them Methods are presented for refining a curves shape to maintain selfsimilarity which in the limit produces a fractal Methods are also presented for drawing very complex curves based on a small set of stringreplacement rules Tiling the plane with a small set of shapes including reptiles is describedMethods are described for drawing complex images known as strange attractors These methods use the repeated application of a few affine transformations The inverse problem of how to find a set of affine transformations whose attractor is a given image is presented and leads to a discussion of fractal image compression that exploits the technique The celebrated Mandelbrot set and Julia sets are introduced and tools to draw them are developedChapter 10 Chapter 10 discusses powerful graphics methods for manipulating images formed on a raster displayThe basic pix map is revisited as a fundamental object for storing and manipulating images and a number of operations for manipulating pix maps are developed  The classical Bresenhams algorithm for drawing lines is described in detail Ways to describe regions in a pix map and to fill them with a color or pattern are developed Particular attention is given to filling a polygonal region The phenomenon of abasing that plagues graphics programmers is discussed and some techniques for reducing aliasing are developed The techniques of dithering and error diffusion that produce the effect of more colors than a device can display also are describedChapter 11 This chapter is devoted to the design and drawing of smooth curves and surfaces The theory of Bezier and Bspline curves is described along with that for rational Bsplines which leads to a discussion of NURBS curves Interactive curve design is presented wherein a designer specifies a set of control points with a mouse and uses a curvegeneration algorithm to preview the curve associated with those points The curve may either interpolate the points or merely be attracted to themComplex surface design using Bezier Bspline and NURBS patches is also developed and the issue of joining two patches together seamlessly is addressedChapter 12 This chapter examines some intricacies of the human color vision system and addresses the problem of representing colors numerically The CIE standard chromaticity diagram is described along with various ways to use it in color calculations The color gamuts of various devices also are discussed as are different color spaces and conversions of colors between them The problem of efficient color quantization which attempts to reduce the number of different colors in an image without destroying its visual quality is developedChapter 13 In this chapter several methods are developed for performing proper hidden surface removal HSR in pictures of 3D scenes The difference between imageprecision and objectprecision algorithms is discussed along with ways to preprocess the polygonal faces in a scene for rapid HSR The depthbuffer method first seen in Chapter 8 is examined more deeplySeveral HSR methods based on sorting the list of faces to allow rapid rendering including the binary space partition approach are discussed A scanline HSR method also is developed and its advantages over the depthbuffer method are described Further HSR methods based on a divideandconquer approach are also discussedChapter 14 Chapter 14 introduces the powerful raytracing approach to rendering scenes with high realism Working through this chapter the student can first develop a primitive but simple ray tracer and then add on capabilities to ultimately produce a full ray tracer that can generate dazzling images Methods to intersect rays with various shapes are described followed by ways to render the objects using different shading models The physically based CookTorrance reflection model which OpenGL cannot provide is developed for use in ray tracing Techniques for painting texture onto raytraced surfacesboth 3D textures such as marble and imagebased texturesare described in detail Methods to speed up ray tracing using bounding boxes are also developedA great advantage of ray tracing is that it automatically performs HSR and makes it easy to create exact shadows of objects In addition it allows one to simulate the reflection of light from shiny surfaces as well as the refraction of light through transparent objects Methods to accomplish each of these aims are described The chapter ends with a thorough discussion of ray tracing complex objects formed by using constructive solid geometry   Suggested Paths through the BookAll suggested paths through the book include Chapters 1 through 5 as fundamental although Chapter 4 can be perused independently by students who are familiar with vectors Chapter 9 can be tackled after Chapter 5 with no loss in continuity as can Chapter 10 The 2D parts of Chapter 11 also may be studied after Chapter 5   Possible Course Plans For a onesemester undergraduate course in which interest is highest in 3D graphics Chapters 1 through 5 with parts of Chapter 6 and

STEREO PICTURESSeveral stereoscopic figures appear in the book to clarify discussions of 3D situations They appear as a pair of nearly identical figures placed side by side To gain the full value of these pictures coerce your left eye to look at the lefthand picture alone and your right eye to look at the righthand one alone This may take practice Some people catch on quickly others only after many blearyeyed attempts and some people never Of course the figures still help to clarify the discussion even without the stereo effectOne way to practice viewing these figures is to hold the index fingers of each hand upright in front of you about 2 inches apart and to stare through them at a blank wall in the distance Each eye naturally sees two fingers but they seem to overlap in the middle This overlap is precisely what is desired when looking at stereo figures Each eye sees two figures but the middle ones are brought into perfect overlap When the middle fingers fuse together like this the brain constructs a single 3D image out of them Some people find it helpful to place a piece of white cardboard between the two figures and to rest their nose on it The cardboard barrier prevents each eye from seeing the image intended for the other eye",

        "Chapter 1AngelINTRODUCTIONInfluenced by a long tradition of religious symbolism in painting and poetry our imagination responds to the word angel by picturing a winged figure robed in dazzling white and having the bodily aspect of a human beingThis image common to believers and unbelievers contains features which represent some of the elements of meaning in the abstract conception of angels as this is found in the writings of Jewish and Christian theologians and in related discussions by the philosophers The human appearance suggests that angels like men are persons that they are most essentially characterized by their intelligence The wings suggest the function of angels  their service as messengers from God to man The aura of light which surrounds them signifies according to established conventions of symbolism the spirituality of angels It suggests that to imagine angels with bodies is to use a pictorial metaphorAnother interpretation might be put upon this aura of light if one considers the role which the notion of angel has played in the history of thought Wherever that notion has entered into discussions of God and man of matter mind and soul or knowledge and love and even of time space and motion it has cast light upon these other topics The illumination which has been and can be derived from the idea of angels as a special kind of being or nature is in no way affected by doubts or denials of their existenceWhether such beings exist or not the fact that they are conceivable has significance for theory and analysis Those who do not believe in the existence  or even the possible existence  of utopias nevertheless regard them as fictions useful analytically in appraising accepted realities What an ideal society would be like can be considered apart from the question of its existence and so considered it functions as a hypothesis in political and economic thought What sort of being an angel would be if one existed can likewise serve as a hypothesis in the examination of a wide variety of theoretical problemsThe idea of angels does in fact serve in precisely this way as an analytical tool It sharpens our understanding of what man is how his mind operates what the soul is what manner of existence and action anything would have apart from matter Hence it suggests how matter and its motions in time and space determine the characteristics of corporeal existence Pascals remark  that man is neither angel nor brute and the unfortunate thing is that he who would act the angel acts the brute  points to the different conceptions of man which result from supposing him to be either angel or brute rather than neither Such views of human nature considered in the chapters on Animal and Man cannot be fully explored without reference to theories of the human mind or soul in its relation to matter and to body As the chapters on MIND and SOUL indicate theories carrying the names of Plato and Descartes which attribute to the human mind or soul the being and powers of a purely spiritual substance or entity seem to place man in the company of the angels In this tradition Locke applies the word spirits equally to human minds and to suprahuman intelligenceIt would be misleading to suppose that the idea of angels is primarily a construction of the philosophers  a fiction invented for their analytical purposes or that it is simply their conception of a supramundane reality concerning the existence and nature of which they dispute In the literature of western civilization angels first appear by name or reference in the Old and the New Testaments Readers of the Bible will remember many scenes in which an angel of the Lord performs the mission of acquainting man with Gods will Among the most memorable of such occasions are the visits of the angels to Abraham and Lot and the angelic ministry of Gabriel in the Annunciation to MaryIn one book of the Bible Tobias Tobit as it is called in the King James Apocrypha one of the leading characters is the angel Raphael Through most of the story he appears as a man but at the end after he has accomplished his mission he reveals his identity I am the angel Raphael he declaresone of the seven who stand before the LordAnd when they had heard these things they were troubled and being seized with fear they fell upon the ground on their faceAnd the angel said to them Peace be to you Fear notFor when I was with you I was there by the will of God bless ye him and sing praises to himI seemed to eat and to drink with you but I use an invisible meat and drink which cannot be seen by menIt is time therefore that I return to him that sent meAnd when he had said these things he was taken from their sight and they could see him no moreAs a result of scriptural exegesis and commentary the angels become a fundamental topic for Jewish theologians from Philo to Maimonides and for such Christian theologians as Augustine Scotus Erigena Gregory the Great Aquinas Luther Calvin Pascal and Schleiermacher They figure in the great poetry of the JudeoChristian tradition  inThe Divine Comedyof Dante inParadise Lostof Milton and in ChaucersThe Canterbury Talesand GoethesFaustThe philosophers especially in the 17th and 18th centuries are motivated by Scripture or provoked by theology to consider the existence the nature and the activity of angels Hobbes for example attacks the supposition that angels are immaterial on the ground that the notion of incorporeal substance is selfcontradictory and undertakes to reinterpret all the scriptural passages in which angels are described as spirits After examining a great many he says that to mention all the places of the Old Testament where the name of Angel is found would be too long Therefore to comprehend them all at once I say there is no text in that part of the Old Testament which the Church of England holdeth for Canonical from which we can conclude there is or hath been created any permanent thing understood by the name ofSpiritorAngel that hath not quantity and in sum which is not taking Body for that which is somewhat or somewhere CorporealAll the passages can be interpreted Hobbes thinks simply in the sense in which angel means messenger and most often a messenger of God which signifies anything that makes known his extraordinary presence If instead of existing only when they carry Gods word to men the angels are supposed to have permanent being then they must be corporeal As in the resurrection men shall be permanent and not incorporeal Hobbes writes so therefore also are the angelsTo men that understand the signification of these wordssubstanceandincorporeal and mean by incorporeal having no body at all not just asubtlebody  the words taken together imply a contradiction Hence Hobbes argues that to say an angel or spirit is in that sense an incorporeal substance is to say in effect that there is no angel or spirit at all Considering therefore the signification of the wordangelin the Old Testament and the nature of dreams and visions that happen to men by the ordinary way of nature Hobbes concludes that the angels are nothing but supernatural apparitions of the fancy raised by the special and extraordinary operation of God thereby to make his presence and commandments known to mankind and chiefly to his own peopleLocke seems to take the exactly opposite position Asserting that we have no clear or distinct idea of substance in general he does not think spirits any less intelligible than bodies The idea

        "The Jesus figure central to Girzones earlier bestsellers Joshua and Joshua and the Children  is once again introduced into a contemporary setting This time he first appears as a young man dressed in baggy khakis beckoning across a field in the dream of a newly consecrated bishop David Campbell Bishop Campbell is known for his strict interpretation of church law often at the cost of the human element Profoundly changed by the dream and soon after by a meeting with that friendly stranger Joshua Campbell embarks on a radical plan to implement the message of Jesus He dismantles the chancery joins forces with his peers in other sects and forms small communities bound by faith acts that court the wrath of his clerical enemies Events reach boiling point over Campbells ingenious maneuver with the compliance of the pope to retain a married priest Latenight calls to a friendly pope and advice from Joshua who dwells in a compound for the homeless are prelude to the imaginative conclusion of Campbells spiritual campaign Girzones undemanding prose and nondidactic approach to the implementation of the Christian message in modern times is beguilingCopyright 1990 Reed Business Information Inc",
